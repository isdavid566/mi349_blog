        <p>I went home this weekend, as I haven't been home in a while and to celebrate my (belated) birthday. I didn't do much, but it was nice to be home and spend time with family. It is a lot warmer at home than it is at my apartment.</p>

        <p>I bought a new umbrella because the one I bought last month broke the first time I used it. Nothing was really wrong with it, it just won't stay open. Every time it's been raining and I was out, I had to hold it open with one arm, which is an arm workout, but it worked.</p>

        <p>Me and my family also got some dessert! My mom let me pick and I chose key lime pie. My friend ordered some dessert for the two of us to celebrate my birthday a few days ago, and I've been craving it ever since. It's pretty good. We're halfway through the pie now. My mom says its too sweet (the crust), but I think it works well since the pie itself is tart and sour.</p>

        <p>I want to get some cinnamon rolls eventually---I've been craving them for a while. I could get them whenever I wanted, I just haven't.</p>

        <h2>Different Types of Desserts</h2>

        <p>I'm actually a terrible baker (I find cooking easier), but I love trying new desserts. </p>

        <p>Recently, my roommate and I made chocolate meringues, except the egg whites never whipped so the meringues were flat. It was still delicious, though it did take two attempts. <br>
        The first attempt, the egg whites hardly whipped at all. It turned out that plastic bowls aren't good for making meringues, as they can store fat from previously mixed things, which would make the meringues deflate. Furthermore, we used cold eggs, when room-temperature eggs are needed. We did it the proper way the second way, though we lacked the cream of tartar or lemon to help it have stiff peaks. </p>
        <table>    
            <tr>
                <th>Dessert</th>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Main Ingredients</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chocolate Cake</td>
                <td>Cake</td>
                <td>Flour, cocoa, sugar, eggs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tiarmisu</td>
                <td>Pudding</td>
                <td>Mascarpone, coffee, cocoa</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cheesecake</td>
                <td>Cake</td>
                <td>Cream cheese, sugar, biscuit base</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>We're planning on trying to bake other things too eventually. We bought pancake batter, though we haven't made it yet. I think we'll try something more simple, like boxed brownies or cookies. I think that could be fun. We have all of the ingredients, so it wouldn't be hard to make. </p>

        <p>If I was a good baker, I'd like to make macarons. I've always heard how difficult macarons are to make, as they are finicky. I've even heard that macarons have to be made in certain temperatures, as they are sensitive to both temperature and humidity. </p>
